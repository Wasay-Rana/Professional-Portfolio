# Wasay's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, where you can learn more about me, my skills, and my projects.

## About Me

I'm Wasay, currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science. I'm passionate about technology, particularly in the fields of machine learning and web development. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing chess, experimenting with new recipes, and exploring nature.

Feel free to explore the code in this repository, also i have sourced the code from this youtube video {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKptmUVIBM} and reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project. Thanks for visiting!
